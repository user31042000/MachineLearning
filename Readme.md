# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains implementations, projects, and notes on core machine learning concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. It is organized into folders for datasets, Jupyter notebooks, source code, models, and utilities, with hands-on examples using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.   The repo covers algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs, clustering, PCA, and neural networks, with examples of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization. Contributions are welcome through pull requests.
